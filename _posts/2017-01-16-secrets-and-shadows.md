So here's the refined and prettified version of my Apocalypse World/Lady Blackbird inspired (powered?) game.

[*Secrets and Shadows*]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2017-01-16/SecretsandShadows_v1_alpha.pdf)

I went back to the drawing board a little, using the concept I posted a few days ago. I stumbled over a post on [concentric game design](http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/594) in Apocalypse World, and it seemed only right to rebuild things following the principles so generously and awesomely laid out.

To quote from the post, all you really need is:

* Vivid color
* A few stats and a simple die roll
* On a 10+, the best happens. On a 7-9, it's good but complicated. On a miss, it's never nothing, it's always something worse.
* The MC's agenda, principles, and what to always say.

I picked "paranormal romance" as the basis for the "vivid color" but you could easily change that by using different character building options (*The Blackbird Companion* is a great resource for this) and different Principles and Dramatic moves.

The core should be a pretty solid solo experience, with plenty of guidelines for what to do next and how to push the story forward. And I heavily refined how Currency works, to make it more solo friendly.

I also included a simple Oracle for those without Mythic or solo experience. Using this Oracle is not required, of course.

Now all that's left is to run a playtest and tweak anything that needs tweaking, which I should get to pretty soon.
