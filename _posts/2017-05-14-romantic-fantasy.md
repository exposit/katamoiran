I'm a huge fan of [Against the Wicked City](http://udan-adan.blogspot.co.uk/) and his series of [posts](http://www.metafilter.com/163987/Romance-and-Romantic-Fantasy-in-Tabletop-Roleplaying-Games) (metafilter index to the posts) on romantic fantasy.

So I wrote a game of romantic fantasy; here's the playtest draft of [Heirs of Sea and Shadow]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2017-05-14/HeirsofSeaandShadow.pdf).

That's "romantic fantasy" as in tales of adventure in a world where hope and redemption -- and empathy and love -- are far more important than class level and bonuses to hit.

And as in "romance", aka love, meaning there's a strong romantic element.

I'll be honest. I'm tired of grimdark. It bums me out. I don't want to play "heroic" fantasy if there's no chance I can truly win or if the only way to "win" is through violence and meanness.

Not that there isn't a place for combat in a ttrpg; it's one of the core human dramatic conflicts. But there are plenty of games that focus on that aspect. I wanted to try to create something else. Something more than just "here's some rules for combat, you can freeform the rest of it".

Here's the thing; in group play, where you, the player, are limited to one avatar, one character, it probably is best to leave that stuff up to the player's discretion and the groups' comfort level.

In solo, where you have the liberty of being your character's author as well as his player, and where the output is utterly private, rules for handling social encounters can't make you feel uncomfortable in front of a group or reduce your agency. They just open up another area of human experience to explore.

So the design of *Heirs* -- using some mechanical concepts from *Trollbabe* -- is one that emphasizes empathy and diplomacy over combat. Combat is still a viable thing, but it's dangerous and likely to create as many problems as it solves. Of course, I tried to keep this subtle, but it's too early to tell if I succeeded or not.

All from a solo/gmless perspective, with a strong narrative bent.

* simple but sturdy rules for conflict resolution with a d10
* sliding scale attributes
* characters level out, not up
* has a built-in "fading light" setting (but not so tightly linked that you can't use it for other settings too)
* provided basic d100 oracle with yes/no and and/but modifiers

I've been enjoying the system quite a bit, though I haven't yet developed a full campaign for it. It was fun to make a "complete" system with art and character sheets and a setting (my personal favorite part of the process) even if it is kind of mini!

I'm still not 100% on the name but I couldn't think of one I liked better.

This is a PLAYTEST DRAFT and shouldn't be considered perfect or well-tested or as some sort of final word or anything. As usual, any suggestions, feedback, and the like are welcomed and greatly appreciated.
