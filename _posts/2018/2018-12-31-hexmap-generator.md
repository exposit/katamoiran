Who loves hexmaps? Me!!!

So I wrote a script to generate them and then made some watercolor tiles to prettify it.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/{{page.imagefolder}}/hexmap.png" alt="Generated Hexmap" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"/><br>
<i> the output</i>
</center>

A second script then takes the source file and adds some content to it. I'm still fiddling around with the content; nothing seems quite right.

I want it to be full of useful information, evocative, and easy to parse, but there's just so many cool options and so little space!

A rough prototype of the populator (using small source list sizes):

<center>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/{{page.imagefolder}}/example.png" alt="Hexmap Populated" style="width: 50%; height: 50%"/><br>
<i> randomly generated hex contents</i>
</center>

Anyway, still working on it, off and on. Still all over the place, and obviously there are some blanks.
