So it's been awfully quiet around here lately.

I've still been doing my usual solo stuff. Writing one micro game a month for my personal [OMGAM](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/challenge/) challenge. Playtesting those games. Running other long-term campaigns. Digging deep into old theory and new games.

I just haven't been blogging about it.

Don't know why; part of it's that each game has its own page on [katarpgs](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/) and it seems redundant to talk about it here (also, what else would I say?). Part of it is that often a solo's obsolete -- I've got a new system, a better way of doing things, a new shiny toy -- before I have a chance to post it.

And part of it's that my solos seem to be go to dark places over the holidays, which is kind of a funny way to say I get a little blue around this time of year and take it out on my characters.

I guess it just seems like I'm shouting into the dark over here, and not even hearing echoes back.

Anyway, I'm going to try to get a bunch of stuff -- actual plays, mostly, some brief play examples for various games -- posted soonish. Regular posting helps me stay disciplined and creative and that's what matters.
