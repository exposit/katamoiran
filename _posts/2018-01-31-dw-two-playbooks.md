A couple more playbooks, written for Dungeon World. Obviously not playtested. And feedback is more than welcome.

[The Mutable](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jCreBrUWqLafxGeZLAxJLSMTdK-peIu_), a reimagining of my first OSR class, a warrior who gains the abilities of the creatures who harm him and who has a very uneasy relationship with magic in general.

> Other people cast magic; they study it, channel it, shape it like a tool.

> You are magic. It’s part of you, infused into your bones, coursing through your blood, and it demands that you release it...

> A Mutable is shaped by the traumas and horrors they have witnessed, and gains the powers of the creatures that they encounter. Over time, this growing collection of powers warps them into something more – or less – than human.

> A Mutable’s powers are erratic and often dangerous to foes and allies alike; you can never quite trust a Mutable.

> Choose this playbook if you want to have decent fighting ability augmented with a flexible repertoire of effects and abilities that you seek out in play, and if you want the strength of your abilities to be directly predicated on your creativity in using them.

[The Reincarnated](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K7H0PV46AdYW9amVcUd8-93rTB0VRd_h), the Eternal Warrior (or Mage or Thief), doomed to forever reincarnate when he dies, but granted special powers because of it.

> Over and over you die. Over and over you live again, each new life strange and unfamiliar, but better than the alternative...

> A hero who cannot die, who cannot escape this mortal coil no matter how weary. A hero punished by the gods, perhaps under the guise of reward or favored status, perhaps as an outright curse.

> The Reincarnated might just be a poor fool muddling through, any special abilities hard-won through sheer experience at cheating death, or they might be the avatar of some eternal ideal, the embodiment of War or Magic or Pain, or perhaps a bit of both.

> Choose this playbook if you want a hero who can’t die permanently, who has an intimate relationship with Death that grants subtle but dramatic powers, who is often best served by drawing their last breath, and if you don’t mind your hero’s physical form being out of your hands.

My first playbook, [The Celtic Bard](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14SoLRpWNp7ZWtT8ZJiGyhSzItJAiha09), and the [LaTeX template](https://github.com/exposit/dw-min-template-latex).
