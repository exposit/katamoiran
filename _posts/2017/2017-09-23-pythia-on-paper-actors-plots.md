This is part of my attempt to convert some of <a href="https://exposit.github.io/pythia-oracle/">Pythia's</a> more useful random generators into rollable charts.

[*Pythia on Paper: Actors & Plots*]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2017-09-23/PythiaOnPaperActorsPlots.pdf)

This one covers some of the random generators available on the actor and plot panels.

<!--more-->

* The connection/emotion between two actors, or an actor and a group, or an actor and a place.

* A motive generator so your monsters and villains have a reason for what they do and a target for it.

* Ten different plot structures and the tables to fill them out, like demented MadLibs.

* A plot web creator based on what one NPC did or wants to do to another, with a handy fillable grid.

* Lots of fillable fields just because.

My hope is that this will be useful to those folks who have no need for a software tool but might be curious about Pythia's built-in generators.

Having a script to choose elements means a couple of things; first, you aren't limited by any particular number of elements, and second, it's really, really easy to roll up a bunch of elements at once.

Hopefully none of these are too annoying to fill out, given that you only need to do the longer ones when setting up the scenario.
