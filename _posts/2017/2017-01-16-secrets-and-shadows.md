*Edit 1/25: I made a science fiction version loosely inspired by the SF of the 70s and 80s, [Starfarer](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/starfarer/).*

So here's the refined and prettified version of my Apocalypse World/Lady Blackbird inspired (powered?) game.

[*Secrets and Shadows*](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/secretsandshadows/)

I went back to the drawing board a little, using the concept I posted a few days ago. I stumbled over a post on [concentric game design](http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/594) in Apocalypse World, and it seemed only right to rebuild things following the principles so generously and awesomely laid out.

<!--more-->

To quote from the post, all you really need is:

* Vivid color
* A few stats and a simple die roll
* On a 10+, the best happens. On a 7-9, it's good but complicated. On a miss, it's never nothing, it's always something worse.
* The MC's agenda, principles, and what to always say.

I had the second and third elements, pretty much, but not the first -- since it was a generic idea -- and not the last, since how important could those be to a solo gamer?

It only took about ten seconds of jotting down ideas for Agenda and Principles to realize just how valuable they are, *especially* solo, to provide structure and direction.

I picked "paranormal romance", pretty much on a whim, as the basis for the "vivid color" but you could easily change that by using different character building options (*The Blackbird Companion* is a great resource for this) and different Principles. And maybe changing up the Dramatic moves.

The core should be a pretty solid solo experience, with plenty of guidelines for what to do next at each juncture and how to push the story forward. And I heavily refined how Currency works, to make it more solo friendly.

I also included a simple Oracle for those without Mythic or solo experience. Using this Oracle is not required, of course.

Now all that's left is to run a playtest and tweak anything that needs tweaking, which I should get to pretty soon.
