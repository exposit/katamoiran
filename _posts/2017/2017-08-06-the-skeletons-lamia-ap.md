You know I had to make a variant for The Skeletons; I had this vision of a lamia, trapped in a cave, awaiting challengers and petitioners in search of an oracle.

I don't feel comfortable releasing it until I know it's okay with the author of the base game, but I've asked so we'll see.

I ran a game for myself and it was just as much fun as the original. Not as bleak and inexorable but still fun, in a different way.

<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Okay, let's try the Lamia variant. I choose Tattered Cloak; my lamia is serpent from the waist down, scaled everywhere else but with just a scattering across the face.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Her scales, skin, and hair are the color of sand, with patches of dark red here and there.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">She carries a battle-scarred sword.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I draw my map as before, adding a tunnel and a cave. I mark the edges of the mountain and the desert, too.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">The seven niches along the southern wall each hold a knight sworn to the service of the high king; legend says they will rise again to life when he calls for them.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I'll choose a question to ask about the cave since I'm playing solo; I pick the one about fabulous treasure and mark it on the map.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">It's a star sapphire as big as two fists; it was buried to keep it safe but now it is forgotten.</p>
<p id="fiction">The Unsealed Tomb...</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Bandits.</p>
<p id="fiction">I am roused from my slumber in my warm, dark cave by the sound of squabbling. Bandits; they have built a fire at the entrance to my cave and are arguing about who will be the first to enter.</p>
<p id="fiction">I kill those who come near enough; after the first few, the rest flee. I amuse myself arranging their corpses around the dusty, unused table I find near one wall of the cave, but I am soon sleepy and must dream.</p>
<p id="fiction">I wonder if I am here justly; some part of me finds this revolting. I decide I must be.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[One Options] fades, laughs</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] laughs</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">So a memory proves false.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I only have one recovered so there you go.</p>
<p id="fiction">As I drift to sleep I remember that I was a woman of peace, not murder, and I know that those impulses come from the serpent half.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Time passes.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Just a day.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  5  ] 5</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A merchant and guards.</p>
<p id="fiction">I have scarcely dozed off when my slumber is once again interrupted; three men, two armed, the third the leader. They are fleeing a dust storm, and carry sacks of spices and dried foodstuffs. The leader begs the pardon of the corpses at the table before realizing that they are mere corpses.</p>
<p id="fiction">Their terror amuses me and I suffer them to live, as long as they do not approach the tunnel. They flee as soon as the storm breaks, abandoning one of the sacks.</p>
<p id="fiction">The scent of spices transports me to a distant time, when I was a mortal and had many lovers in a gilded palace.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[One Options] fades, laughs</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] fades</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I can now travel, as long as I don't lose sight of the cave's mouth. It's a desert so that's fairly far. I explore and find an oasis at the base of the slope to my cave.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Time passes...</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  5  ] 5</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A year later...</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  3  ] 3</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">The Time of Dust</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Hoplites!</p>
<p id="fiction">I awaken, uncoiling from the shadows as the stuff of nightmares. The grim-faced soldiers ignore me!</p>
<p id="fiction">They are intent upon their goal, to march down the tunnel and steal what I am here to guard. I kill all but the leader; he reminds me of one of my lovers, now lost to me.</p>
<p id="fiction">I leave him alive for a long while, to tell me who might follow and to amuse myself, and to stave off the sleep that must come. He eventually asks my name, and I consider, and remember, and tell him.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[One Options] fades, laughs</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] laughs</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">... that makes sense; offspring.</p>
<p id="fiction">The child that results from this dalliance is human; I allow him to take it and flee, on pain of death should either return.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Time passes.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Just a month this time, things are moving very slowly.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  5  ] 5</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Oooh, an adventuring company!</p>
<p id="fiction">I murder them all for waking me; one of them, a thief, escapes down the tunnel into the tomb, and I discover that I cannot pass into the tomb proper.</p>
<p id="fiction">It makes no difference, for there is no other exit. I wait and watch for many days, until the Sleep returns, signalling his death.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">... I may merge that with the Lost Travellers and put something else in its place.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">My Lamia has yet to do any foretelling.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[One Options] fades, laughs</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] fades</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">That's already marked, so the next up -- is something I remember a truth or dream?</p>
<p id="fiction">The memory of my name is thrown into question, as I dream of being both a feared sorceress and a simple peasant girl.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Time passes.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Just another another month, ha.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A dragon.</p>
<p id="fiction">It is not long before another guest arrives, this one a serpent as myself but much greater.</p>
<p id="fiction">My Gift tells me that it knows the key to my curse, and I ask it the price; it demands that I spare the life of one who will come in the future, and in return, it tells me that that one will set me free.</p>
<p id="fiction">I know it tells the truth, for my serpent half is drawn from its flesh, and it wishes to be whole again -- but it is patient.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Since we're in the final phase, both charts should be rolled on.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  3  ] 3</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">So that's "my gift of prophecy becomes erratic"; it now can only see outcomes that result in death.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">The next unchecked on the other chart is "a rediscovered area of the tomb contains something precious to me".</p>
<p id="fiction">I spend the time until sleep comes again pacing the length of the tunnel, wearing a groove with my tail.</p>
<p id="fiction">As I become drowsy I notice that the ceiling of the small room that separates the two ends of the tunnel has been painted with the portrait of a beautiful woman with an uncompromising stare, holding a serpent in one hand fearlessly.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Time passes.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  5  ] 5</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">An age passes!</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">So that's both charts.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A section of the cave crumbles, revealing a small cave system.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Within is the treasury of the one I am guarding, all of the treasures save the most important -- those lie interred with the body.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  4  ] 4</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">And the carved friezes have lost their paint.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A wayward god in search of something.</p>
<p id="fiction">My sleep is interrupted a blink of an eye later by a youth, beautiful and fearless, who demands that I tell him where the human he has lost has gone.</p>
<p id="fiction">He is not pleased with my answer, for I may See only those things that belong to death, and I See his love clearly.</p>
<p id="fiction">I am not afraid, and I remember that once, before I was this, I spoke freely with his kin, and was known for this.</p>
<p id="fiction">I offer him the star sapphire that hides beneath my sleeping place; it is imbued with my powers and will help him see his path, should he pursue it. His reward is a boon that I may claim when I need it.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  4  ] 4</p>
<p id="fiction">I find that my scales are shedding, and my skin is smooth beneath, though still serpentine.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  5  ] 5</p>
<p id="fiction">He tells me a secret before he goes; that the thief I thought dead before my last sleep did not die, but rather escaped, carrying a sword that renders the one who carries it impervious to me.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Time passes.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">This is the last sleep, and the last intruder.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  6  ] 6</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">An epoch...</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I'm not sure if "three time on either or both" means six times total or three times total; I'll go with the latter.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  4  ] 4</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  4  ] 4</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  2  ] 2</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Thick dust, until we appear to be statues.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A city arises, just within sight of the cave's mouth.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Ephemeral things decay away; metal rusts and tarnishes.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">And the final intruder.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">Rolling 1d6 1 times.<br>[  1  ] 1</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">A ruler-in-exile, here to claim the tomb's contents as proof of right to rule.</p>
<p id="fiction">When I awake, I find I am enshrouded in dust, and I am too lethargic to move. A man I recognize instantly as the one the dragon foretold strides confidently through my cave, and the skulls of those I have slain crumble to dust as he passes.</p>
<p id="fiction">He carries the sword, and wears the sapphire on a chain. I demand to know why he is here, and what business he has in my cave, but it is all a formality, for I can See my death approaching.</p>
<p id="fiction">His words are bold; he will seize a throne that should be his by right, and that I will not bar his path for he has undergone many trials and his people are counting on him.</p>
<p id="fiction">And then he hesitates, and asks me a question of his own. He wants to know how he can help me.</p>
<p id="fiction">I laugh with joy as an act of unforced kindness, the first in my long servitude, ends my curse.</p>
<p id="fiction">I cannot See what will happen next, but I have hope.</p>
