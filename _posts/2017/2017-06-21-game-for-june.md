Inspired by the 200 Word RPG contest, I thought it would be fun to challenge myself to write at least one microRPG a month for the next year.

<!--more-->

Here's the first, [*Conflicts & Complications*](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/conflictsandcomplications/), a two d6 attempt at combining oracle and game into one information-packed roll.

I also wrote a [companion adventure](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/conflictsandcomplications/) in the "CYOA" format; it's mostly system agnostic and plays into the example game in *Conflicts & Complications*. It's also highly experimental; an attempt to control the narrative while allowing plenty of room for improvisation.

I was trying to go for a companion format for C&C that would be easily moddable but I don't think this is it!

As usual, these are not playtested by anyone but me yet. Let me know if you see anything weird or odd or just want to discuss.
