Here's a d66 chart of Dungeon Dressing pulled from [A Simple Solo Delve](https://exposit.github.io/katarpgs/superlite/simplesolo/). It's sanitized and relatively pithy.

And if you want something a little more challenging and gonzo, here's a [python script](https://github.com/exposit/katamoiran/blob/master/python/charts/dungeon_dressing.py) lifted from Pythia, with roughly 180 elements. This is the original source for the d66 list.

Which is about the same as the "bad things that happened when you touched that thing in the dungeon" list, haha. I should put that one up next!
