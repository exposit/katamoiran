Substantial additions to the site, but not much oomph to show for it, I'm afraid. Mainly, I redid categories so they're more accurate and top level, then made landing pages for each category to show just posts from that category.

I also updated each post to show what category and tags it belongs to. Should be fairly transparent to the end user and all.

Still no idea what to use as the title graphic, though.
