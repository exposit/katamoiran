    title: The Skeletons
    source: Bully Pulpit Games
---

A game for 1-6 players where you take the role of a skeleton cursed to protect a tomb throughout the ages.

Gameplay is cyclic; first you identify an intruder, then you deal with them while answering a question about your skeleton, then you determine how much time has passed, then you repeat, all with variations that give a strong sense of time passing and the years crumbling the world around you.

Cool stuff.

So how did it work solo? Very well. Though I can see how this would really shine with a group to bounce ideas off of, solo was easy. There were a couple of points where I misunderstood the rules and later wished I hadn't, but nothing game breaking at all.

I went with a "sketch it out" approach rather than a full narrative style, mostly because I was feeling casual.

There's no real randomness except what will happen next, so it's a very different adventure than a standard dungeon crawl. You know you're going to make it through the ages, one way or another; it's more about how you'll get there and what you'll have gained and lost in the process.

The one place I felt like I could really have used more instruction is the very end; I just wasn't sure where to go with things. Was a partial victory allowed? What exactly counted as "defeat" for a skeleton?

I figured it out on my own, which was likely as intended, but I wasn't sure I was being true to the game or to my fiction-as-established. Does that matter? I don't know. I feel happy about my adventure, so that's what matters to me.

There are two variants included, which means plenty of replay value. I'm already considering how I'll play the Fire Mountain variant with a non-skeleton undead!

Note: I'm kind of inconsistent with how I choose elements; the author suggests just going up to the nearest unused option but I missed that at first. Also, while I tried to avoid verbatim quotes from the source, it's still pretty spoiler-y.

<p id="fiction">He is well-prepared, and confident; he smells of incense and gold. He does not expect the tomb to be guarded so soon after occupancy.</p>
<p id="fiction">This makes it easy, when he opens the sarcophagus, to run him through.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I can answer two questions from my sheet.</p>
<p id="fiction">The dead robber was my cousin, and he's the one who killed me.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="aside">It just says I have to deal with them.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] robbers</p>
<p id="fiction">They are wearing strange clothes and carrying strange lights. One is a fighter, the other a thief. They focus on the sarcophagus; the mosaics that once marked each of the seven chamber's doors have faded and hard to see in torchlight.</p>
<p id="fiction">One of my snares trips up the fighter, who is left limping. He curses out the thief who shrugs, then the two of them push open the lid to the sarcophagus.</p>
<p id="fiction">They are disappointed at the empty tomb and fall to arguing, then fighting. It's trivial for me to dispatch the fighter from behind.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Two questions; hmm.</p>
<p id="fiction">I see the symbol around the thief's neck and recognize it as one I used to wear; an eight-pointed sun with a hole in the center. I stay my hand a moment, thinking, and he turns tail and flees.</p>
<p id="fiction">Before he leaves the edge of the tomb, I suddenly remember that I was known as the Sun Triumphant, and that I ruled from one sea to another.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="aside">It's a bandit army, armed with shovels and torches and strange machinery.</p>
<p id="fiction">They are no match for my snares and traps, laid cunningly over the past century as I eke out the time. It's not long before their courage breaks; only a dozen or so die before that.</p>

<p id="fiction">The ceiling collapses, covering my usual standing spot in dirt and rubble.</p>
<p id="fiction">This causes the door nearest to collapse, revealing a small chamber holding the remnants of my earliest life; a well-preserved bow, rotted leather armor, a quiver covered with beadwork.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="aside"></p>
<p id="fiction">Many of them are killed by traps and snares, but the final confrontation is between myself and the necromancer. She wears the Heavenly Blue Ring Mail and it gleams like nothing else in this place has for a thousand years.</p>
<p id="fiction">We exchange blows, none decisive. She uses magic and aggression to compel me but I remember who I am and am resolute.</p>
<p id="fiction">She orders me to heel, but I remember conquering an empire. She tempts me to her service, but I remember love. She offers revenge, but I no longer have a taste for it.</p>
<p id="fiction">I recognize in her the same ambition that ruled the girl I once loved.</p>
<p id="fiction">I unclasp my silver torc and offer it to her, and she, bewildered, accepts.</p>
<p id="fiction">As it leaves my fingers I crumble, and am free at last.</p>
