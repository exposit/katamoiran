This is where I start to get a bit bored with the dungeon crawl in general. The old prisoner seemed unlikely to provide much of interest, at least not right away, and I couldn't think of a way for Fin to approach the NPC party (or be able to offer them much if he did so). Fortunately things started looking up immediately after we went down a level.

<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Hit Locs] Right Hand</p>
<p id="fiction">Three bandits were secured by more of the manacles he'd see upstairs. Next to the fire a warrior rested. Her hand was bandaged crudely, as was her leg.</p>
<p id="fiction">Fin hesitated a moment.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Is there any way to slip around the room to the nearest exit?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 3 &le; 10] Exceptional YES</p>
<p id="fiction">There was plenty of shadow, deep shadow, and the campfire would ruin her night vision. He could easily slip around to the far exit without notice.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Does she have any way of detecting him, since she's more in some way than she appears?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 95 &ge; 91] Exceptional NO</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Is she unconscious? Maybe she was ambushed, barely defeated them, got them tied up and passed out.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 60 &ge; 50] NO</p>
<p id="fiction">He shrugged and slipped up closer. "Excuse me," he said mildly, "Have you seen any wine about?"</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Reaction] Embarrassment [strong], disappointment [weak] hidden behind contentment [weak], trust [strong]</p>
<p id="fiction">She shot upright, a flash of embarrassment whipping across her face. "Who are you?" she demanded, her hand dropping to her sword.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Does she appear to be Atriu?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 33 &le; 50] YES<br>[RANDOM] PC negative "Judge Portals"</p>
<p id="fiction">She was tall and fair; one of the Atriu, he guessed.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I'm guessing that the round sphere reacts to him, "judging" him and opening a portal.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Is it reacting to:</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[List Options] Merodr heritage, Elderspawn heritage,</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="query">Interesting; well, let's see if he needs to make a saving throw?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 14 &le; 50] YES</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Roll] Saving throw vs. Constitution</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Great. He has no modifiers to that.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Failed.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[What Did It Do?] It removed an aspect of your alignment or morality. You are knocked unconscious.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Huh, interesting.</p>
<p id="fiction">He started to introduce himself; the round sphere hummed and suddenly flared to life with a brilliant flash.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">How long will the effect last for?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[More or Less] Much less than one day.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Well, I don't know too much about Fin, to be honest. I know he was raised by a stoic and unloving mage who treated him like an experimental tool. That he's trained as an assassin. That he's stoic.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[List Options] his willingness to murder people, his independence, something else,</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] his willingness to murder people</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Ok, it's a neutralization device. It's designed to remove the will to fight from Elderspawn; he'll suffer the effects for the next hour. Going to have it affect his willingness to lie, too.`</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">How long until he comes to? A few minutes?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[More or Less] Less than expected.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">He's only out a moment then.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">By the way, I'm not sure he actually HAS killed anyone. Just that he's willing to do so.</p>
<p id="fiction">He was lying on the floor, and it was cold and hard and dusty. He didn't feel particularly upset about it, though. He sat up, feeling... peaceful.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I also am not sure he knows either of his major backstory points.</p>
<p id="fiction">"Finian of Cadoc," he introduced himself. The calm, peaceful feeling was persisting, even as she stared coldly at him.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Did she notice the light flash?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 45 &le; 50] YES</p>
<p id="fiction">"What was that?" she asked.</p>
<p id="fiction">He shrugged. "I don't know, but it's completely removed my ability to fight," he said placidly, then clapped a hand over his mouth, eyes widening in as much alarm as he could muster. Had he really just said that?</p>
<p id="fiction">She cocked an eyebrow at him. "I'm the queen of Sentar Nystu," she said experimentally, then shrugged. "I seem to be unaffected." She grinned wryly. "Unless my parents have something they've been keeping from me."</p>
<p id="fiction">Fin made a face, and she laughed. "Sit by the fire, Finian of Cadoc, and tell me what brings you to this hole in the ground."</p>
<p id="fiction">"I don't know," he said honestly. "But my captors demanded I retrieve a cask of wine for them. I'm actually looking for a way out."</p>
<p id="fiction">Her eyes gleamed with mischief. To forestall any questions he'd be bound to answer, he asked one of his own. "What brings you here, then?"</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[List Options] looking for something, looking for someone, other,</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] other</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">[List Options] being hunted, revenge, whim, money,</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Choice] money</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Was she hired as a bodyguard?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 60 &ge; 50] NO</p>
<p id="fiction">"Whim, mostly," she said, "And the promise of treasure." She sighed, glanced down at her hand and leg. "But all I've found are bandits and new expenses."</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Is she from Whitefell?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 74 &ge; 50] NO</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Glywel?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 15 &le; 50] YES</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Well, Fin is a mage, and is torn between the healing side of his magic and the shadowy part of it.</p>
<p id="fiction">"If I may," he said a bit diffidently, "I do have some skill at healing."</p>
<p id="fiction">She cocked her head but acquiesced. He closed his eyes a minute, composing himself, and let the magic work. It was tiring work, but only dangerous if he overextended himself.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">So, he's got three points in it, plus one more makes four. He can heal 1d8+1 points of damage per casting, and it costs him 1 magic point each time.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Will one casting be enough to heal her hand?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 94 &ge; 91] Exceptional NO</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">It's pretty smashed up; he'll need to cast at his full strength to fix it.</p>
<p id="fiction">He frowned a little; her hand was pulped, every bone broken. Nothing he couldn't fix, but it'd take a good chunk of his resources. Still, if he was stuck not wanting to kill anything for a while, it would be good to have a strong arm who owed him a debt.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Ok, so, the max he can pull off is a 4 level, which would be twice that in cost, or 8 tokens, minus one because healing is a specialty for him. So 7 token, leaving him with 2.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Normally that'd be a whopping 4d8+4 hp back. That has to be enough to repair her hand and leg.</p>
<p id="fiction">He felt drained, but pleased. He hardly ever got to use his magic for healing; his patron had demanded he use it for darker purposes and the punishments for disobeying were severe.</p>
<p id="fiction">She unwrapped her hand and flexed her fingers a little. Gave him a grateful look. "Thanks," she said.</p>
<p id="fiction">He nodded. "What's up with them?" he asked, tilting his head towards the three zoned out prisoners.</p>
<p id="fiction">She grimaced. "They thought I was an easy target."</p>
<p id="fiction">He nodded, looked thoughtful. Obviously she wasn't. "If you're not doing anything else," he said slowly, "I could use a hand locating a very old cask of wine..."</p>
<p id="fiction">---</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I won't bother statting her out at this point. Just add her as an actor and some Elite stats.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I tend to deviate from standard SH by giving my NPCs a lot of chances not to just die when the going gets tough. I don't mind retiring them or sending them off to recuperate, but I don't want to get interested in them and have them die instantly because they have basically 3 HP.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">So Elite stats: Elite: HD T, AC 5, Atk +T, Dmg 1d10, MV 30, ML 10</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">That sounds good; I'll check if she has a little more HD than that, though.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[How Difficult?] A bit difficult. [1]</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">So 1 more HD; she's 2 HD, slightly more than he has. AC 5, Atk +2, Dmg 1d10, MV 30, ML10.</p>

<p id="fiction">Three exits lead out of the practice room; the west led to a small room, once used for changing gear, but now used as a lair for some animal. Bones littered the floor arpund a grass nest. There was a hole in the floor where ot had crumbled over yawning darkness.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 8 &le; 10] Exceptional YES</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Ha, it's a genius!</p>
<p id="fiction">"I'm not sure this is such a good idea," Fin said doubtfully.</p>
<p id="fiction">The warrior shot him a look. "We can't just leave whoever it is in there, to die," she said firmly. He sighed and inspected the coffin. This room, like the rest of the fort, was falling apart; there was a large hole in the floor and part of a shattered desk.</p>
<p id="fiction">And a coffin. Someone'd been banging on it when they entered but now there was just faint mumbling.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Is the coffin secured in some way?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 20 &le; 50] YES</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Lock?</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Or she, I suppose. Let's see what this Alfar looks like.</p>

<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Visible Quirk] muscular</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Nothing too evocative, yet.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="result">[Visible Quirk] looks shocked</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">As does Fin, I guess.</p>
<p id="fiction">He didn't have more than an instant to enjoy his triumph before the lid flew open and something surged out, slamming into him and bearing him down to the floor. He saw fangs and wild eyes, and then darkness as the back of his head hit the stone floor hard.</p>
<p id="fiction">---</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">My thought is that the Alfar will quickly come to his senses, stop draining Fin, and parlay with Isa before she skewers him. Or tries to, they're not easy to kill. In fact, that's what made being locked in a box a punishment -- Alfar can't really die.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Isa will grab the journal.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Any chance the wine was in there?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 65 &ge; 50] NO</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">It was just a pretext anyway, I think.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Will they take the unconscious Fin somewhere?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 60 &ge; 50] NO</p>
<p id="fiction">Fin felt groggy and weak and his head hurt fiercely. He opened his eyes and winced a little against the light. He was on the floor again.</p>
<p id="fiction">His eyes focused; Issa was in heated conversation with what looked like an Alfar. The same one that had attacked him, he thought, and was relieved to find that he was capable again of thinking murderous thoughts.</p>
<p id="fiction">"Oh, you're awake," Issa said, breaking off the argument. She extended a hand and helped him to his feet.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Does the Alfar recognize his parentage?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 10 &le; 10] Exceptional YES</p>
<p id="fiction">"Viandus Crespy," the Alfar said formally, giving him a half-bow. "You have my apol-" He stopped, mid-word, and his jaw dropped as he stared, eyes narrowing, at Fin.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">Exceptional yes says he recognizes both parents. Hahaha.</p>
<p id="fiction">Fin resisted the urge to rub the back of his head. "What?" he said a bit crossly. He wasn't in the mood for subtlety.</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="query">Does the Alfar reveal what he knows?</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="oracle">[fifty-fifty, 1 &le; 10] Exceptional YES</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">I'm going to say he reveals the elderspawn part and the bastard part, but not the emperor part, at least not directly.</p>
<p id="fiction">"A bastard, by a nymph," the Alfar said, as if musing out loud. "How very unexpectedly rebelllious of him." He was staring at Fin but his expression said his thoughts were a thousand miles away. "But there's no mistaking it. I wonder how you survived to adulthood."</p>
<p id="fiction">"If you're calling me Tainted," Fin said, "You'd best be prepared to back up your words with steel." It was a bluff, mostly, he felt as weak as a kitten, but he'd be damned if he let anyone-- well, it'd be hard to insult his parentage since for all he knew he'd hatched from an egg, but still. You didn't call a man Tainted without--</p>
<p id="fiction">"Tainted? An odd word for one with the good fortune to not be entirely Man," the Alfar said dismissively, then looked thoughtful again. "If you didn't know about that, you likely don't know about... well. Perhaps it's better you don't."</p>
<p id="fiction">Fin scowled, dropped his hands to his swords. Issa was looking baffled. "Are you saying he's Elderspawn?" she said bluntly, and the Alfar glanced at her. She gave Fin a look like he'd grown a second head.</p>
<p id="fiction">"I'm saying one of his parents was a nymph," the elf said irritably. "The stamp of it is as clear as the stamp of his father." He paused. "Though perhaps not as clear to human eyes," he allowed.</p>
<p id="fiction">Fin wanted to argue, but the elf was so very certain, and to be honest, he knew nothing to disprove -- or prove -- it. He was starting to feel a rather unpleasant suspicion that the pieces of his life were coming together. If he was Tainted, what Issa called Elderspawn, was that where the magic came from? Why old Krex had trained him? He'd always felt like an experiment, but he'd never dreamed he might be -- well, anything other than an entirely human street urchin.</p>
<p id="fiction">"I owe you a debt," the Alfar said formally, giving Fin another half-bow. "I will travel with you until I discharge it."</p>
<p id="fiction">---</p>
<p id="mechanic" class="aside">That was quick. We have a fighter and a...</p>
