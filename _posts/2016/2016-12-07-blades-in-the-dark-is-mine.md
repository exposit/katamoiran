I have been eying this game for months. Putting it on the "when I get time to play" and "maybe when it's finally released" pile. But the sheer awesomeness of *Lady Blackbird* and *Stranger Things* meant I had to get it now. HAD TO.

So I finally bit the bullet and picked up *Blades in the Dark*. But now I'm afraid to read it because I really did just convert half my active characters to *Lady Blackbird* and I haven't even done a single AP with it yet.

What if I love BitD so much I end up having to convert them all AGAIN?

Good problem to have. :)
