I love *Lady Blackbird* and I am having a passionate thing with *Ghost/Echo* and I am fondly affectionate towards *Otherkind*.

But thinking up complications and dangers in play is hard and I feel like I wimp out a lot, going for the easy, Mary Sue complications over the more painful, interesting ones. And I tend to lack variety in my complications because there's no GM to push and pull against creatively.

In *6 Hours to Midnight* one of the Complications for any given roll is already defined for you; you roll or choose from a list. In *Ghost/Echo* you have a selection of moves that indicate when you'll roll and there's an inherent Danger spelled out for each.

So what if there were a nice big 30 element chart you could roll on to pick reasonably sensible complications so you couldn't wimp out?

#### Simple *Otherkind* mechanic you can ignore if you're just here for the complications

Your hero has a goal, or you wouldn't be rolling. That's the Goal. Roll twice on the Dangers & Complications chart, rerolling duplicates, and interpret each result as a complication or danger that might come to pass in the context of the current situation.

Once you have established a Goal and two or more Complications, roll a d6 for each goal and complication and assign the results as you please.

On a 1 - 2, the goal is failed, the way is closed. The complication or danger comes to pass.

On a 3 - 4, the goal is a partial success, the way is still open, or there's still hope of progress. The complication or danger is only partly realized.

On a 5 - 6, the goal is a complete success. The complication or danger is averted.

#### Interpreting Results

When interpreting the Dangers & Complications results, ground the result as much as you can in the existing situation; if you can't think of a way to make it fit, reroll if you must, or delay the complication a bit until you see an opportunity to enact it.

You can always hold a complication or danger for the right moment. And sometimes the danger or complication is just out of left field, didn't see that coming, totally never would have guessed that land. Maybe an NPC's plans just succeeded behind the scenes or maybe it's just really bad luck.

Be as specific as you can. "A broken leg" is better than "I'm hurt" or "I take damage" for "suffer harm". "I fall madly in love" or "I'm so angry I can't see straight" is better than "I'm upset" for "suffer an emotion".
