For the past month or so I've been working on [a tool](https://exposit.github.io/pythia-oracle/) for solo gaming inspired by blogs like [dieheart](http://dieheart.net/useful-stuff/solo-rpg-resources/) and tools like [the Mythic GM Emulator](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator?it=1) and [FU](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/89534/FU-The-Freeform-Universal-RPG). (Note, Mythic isn't included as of yet because I want to clear it with the author, but FU is included and it works wonderfully for solo gaming).

From the [Readme](https://github.com/exposit/pythia-oracle):

>Pythia is a framework to run solo adventures. It uses Python 2.7 and Kivy and will probably run on any platform they will. I wrote it with two goals in mind; first, I wanted to be able to generate content on the fly for my multi-player sandbox campaign while keeping track of that content and second, I wanted to be able to run solo characters through adventures that would surprise me. There are many great GM emulating tools out there, software and print. This is what works for me.

<!--more-->

Essentially, this is the tool I use for solo gaming and for tracking and generating random content for my sandbox Godbound campaign. If a player asks me a question, I ask Pythia and whatever comes back, stands as world canon. If I need to know which kingdom an NPC comes from (or which of a handful of names that I like belongs to the Crown Prince) I use the pick one feature. I use it to confirm if my guesses are correct or if mechanics work the way I think they do. Best of all, it keeps track of everything for me - if I roll up a result I think I might need to refer to, I bookmark it or save it in the tracker.

Solo gaming works about the same -- I do character generation using the quicksave, then make a fresh game for the adventure.

Anyway, I'm mostly putting this post up so I have a place (in addition to github) to answer questions and for people to let me know about content they'd like added -- so ask and tell away!
