I wasn't satisfied with my one page *Lady Blackbird* and *Apocalypse World* mashups. It just didn't feel like I was getting my style across.

So I went back to the drawing board, revamped everything, gave the base system a name ("Calypso"), and put together a compiled version of all the rules and scenarios I've made so far, along with the Traits, Secrets, and Keys I use for my own games. And added a few more scenarios, just for good measure.

So this is the first playtest version of [*The Calypso Compendium*]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/2017-02-20/TheCalypsoCompendium.pdf).

<!--more-->

>> The Calypso system is a mashup of stripped-down Apocalypse World mechanics and Lady Blackbird character generation, with a heaping helping of general soloing techniques, run through the blender of my idiosyncratic playstyle.

>> Calypso is designed to support open-ended, strongly narrative solo gaming. It’s designed to provide a framework for you to run games that create stories, stories that will surprise and hope- fully delight you as you experience them.

>> And it’s designed to leverage two amazing group- play games – Lady Blackbird and Apocalypse World – for solo play, and to be compatible with both of them and their derivatives.

* Apocalypse World derived mechanics, Lady Blackbird derived character generation.
* Characters and mechanics designed to work with most if not all pbtA games from a solo angle.
* A simple soloing oracle that can be replaced with your own favorite very easily.
* A few techniques I use to keep my games' plots "on track".
* Around 15 pages of character options which, with the exception of the Secrets, can be used with Lady Blackbird.
* Six scenarios in the style of *Starfarer*, including paranormal romance, superheroes, high fantasy, low fantasy, science fiction, and paranormal mystery.
* A handful of actor creation generators from Pythia that I use all the time.
* The distilled down scene structures from *6 Against the Dark, *6 Days to Adventure* and *6 Feet Under*.

Obviously this is a draft and still very much in playtesting, because there is totally no way I could test all this material by myself. But it's pretty reflective of how I personally am solo gaming right now.

Any and all feedback is welcome and solicited. Would love any playtests and proofreading and just general advice!
